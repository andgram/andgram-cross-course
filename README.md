### Overview

Welcome to the Rainy Days web project! This project is part of our study on HTML and CSS, where we've developed a fictional company's website. In thi case, I choose a company that sells rain jackets. The main goal was to create a responsive and modern design that not only showcases the product but also enhances the user experience.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Modern Aesthetics:** I've employed modern design principles to make the jackets look appealing and the overall website visually engaging.
- **User-Friendly Interface::** Navigating through the website is intuitive, with clear menus and smooth transitions, making it easy for visitors to explore the product catalog and make purchases.
